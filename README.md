# Module_19_Challenge
My submission for the GWU Fintech Bootcamp Module 19 challenge

## For this submission, I used Streamlit, Python, and Web3.py to create an interactive Dapp 
## where individuals can hire fintech professionals and pay for their services with ETH 
## through a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Included in this readME are some screenshots 
## of the user interface of the Dapp, as well as images of the Ganache backend recording the transactions 
## on the private blockchain that the dapp is connected to
