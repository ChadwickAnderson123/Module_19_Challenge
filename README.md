# Module_19_Challenge
My submission for the GWU Fintech Bootcamp Module 19 challenge

# What's in the project?
For this project, I used Python, Streamlit, and the Web3.py library to create a dapp where individuals can hire fintech professionals and pay for their services with ETH through a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Included in this readME are some screenshots of the user interface of the Dapp, 
as well as images of the Ganache backend recording the transactions on the private blockchain that the dapp is connected to
